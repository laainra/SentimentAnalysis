# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. You can build a simple sentiment analysis tool using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Using Text Blob
Text Blob is a Python library for Natural Language Processing. Using Text Blob for sentiment analysis is quite simple. It takes text as an input and can return polarity and subjectivity as outputs.

# Polarity
determines the sentiment of the text. Its values lie in [-1,1] where -1 denotes a highly negative sentiment and 1 denotes a highly positive sentiment.

# Subjectivity 
determines whether a text input is factual information or a personal opinion. Its value lies between [0,1] where a value closer to 0 denotes a piece of factual information and a value closer to 1 denotes a personal opinion.
